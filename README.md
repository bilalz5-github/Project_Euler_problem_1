# Project Euler Problem 1

This project contains two files: Threeand5.java and function.java.

## Threeand5.java

### Description

This file defines a Java class named `Threeand5` and contains a main method. It assigns a large value to a double variable named `Num1`.

### Usage

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Compile the Threeand5.java file using a Java compiler.
   ```
   javac Threeand5.java
   ```

2. Execute the compiled file.
   ```
   java Threeand5
   ```

## function.java

### Description

This file defines a Java class named `function` and contains a main method. It initializes two integer variables, `Num1` and `Num2`, and calculates their sum in a loop until `Num2` exceeds 4,000,000. It also checks if the sum is divisible by 2 and adds it to the sum if true. Finally, it prints the value of the sum.

### Usage

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Compile the function.java file using a Java compiler.
   ```
   javac function.java
   ```

2. Execute the compiled file.
   ```
   java function
   ```
